            <p class="nola">Just over a decade ago, I was lucky enough to have my first tour into North Korea</p>
            <p class="nola">I was working for a large travel company based in the UK leading tours worldwide when I was asked to lead this trip. My thought process was a mess – I had never been to North Korea and at the time it wasn’t high on my list. I had images of needing an armed convoy as you would in a war-torn country. But it didn’t take long to convince me as the lure of a new country with amazing history, ancient and modern, was enough for me to accept. thought process was a mess – I had never been to North Korea and at the time it wasn’t high on my list.

            <p class="nola">My first port of call was the Koryo office to meet with Nick Bonner and Simon Cockerell. I was amazed at the amount of information they had alongside their knowledge and passion for this part of the world. I left laden with books, CDs and information.
